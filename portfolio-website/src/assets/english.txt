A few words

About me

Hi! I'm Alex, a junior front-end web developer currently focused on learning as much as I can. Even though I've been working as a sales representative in the Pharma industry for over 10 years, in 2019 I started learning web development and soon realised I want to change careers.

Allthough I've accumulated most of my knowledge from books, on-line courses and different other sources from around the internet, in late 2019 I decided to enroll in Link Academy's front-end web development course, which I finished and graduated in late 2020.

Last summer I started working on some personal projects because I felt I needed to practice the things that I learned. I then realised that it speeded up my learning process and to this day building projects is my preffered way of improving my skill set.

The next step and also my personal and professional short term goal is to get a job as a web developer and hopefully find an environment that will help me learn and progress into a full stack role.

Im proficient in these

Web technologies
